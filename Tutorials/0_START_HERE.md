# Welcome to Apache Beam tutorials

These notebooks go through the basic operations that Apache Beam has to offer.
Each notebook is separated into different topics. At the end of each section,
there is an exercise to test your knowledge, along with hints.

1.  [Basic operations](1_BasicOperations.ipynb) covers the most basic operations
    and how to design pipelines.

2.  [Element-wise operations](2_ElementWiseOperations.ipynb) demonstrates
    element level operations.

3.  [Aggregations](3_Aggregations.ipynb) shows how to aggregate PCollections.

4.  [Windows](4_Windows.ipynb) contains examples of pipelines using Windows.

5.  [I/O operations](5_IOOperations.ipynb) covers how to interact with outside
    sources.

6.  [Streaming](6_Streaming.ipynb) includes examples of streaming pipelines,
    including a Dataflow example.

7.  [Final exercises](7_FinalExercises.ipynb) tests you on the content from the
    notebooks.
